# HD-Regression-Models
The included file is a zip of the regression models used in regression analysis of the binary dependent variaible "Heart Disease"

The data file named "heart_2020_cleaned" contains the unedited download from Kaggle- full citation available in my Capstone write up.
Files beginning with number 2 are data visialization- 2a is the original review, 2 is a cleaned up version.
Filed beginning with a 3, a through g are different regression analyses of the heart disease data.
  These include linear, logistic, probit and naive Bayes.
  I included work with oversampling as well as normalization using log10, but did not utilize these in the final model.
File "3H" is the final regression model utilized in the later part of my project.  
  On the training data the model score was over 90%.  This model also perfoemed over 90% when run on test data.
"Final Model Results"- contains the test data set used to measuer the regression model as well as the actual and predicted values for the heart disease variable.

The remaining files are working documents that did not directly contribute to the final model.
